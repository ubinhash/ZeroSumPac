# ZERO SUM PACT

ZERO SUM PACT is a project that brings together art, history, and strategy into an collabratvie on-chain experience.

## 1. NFT Collection SHAPAC 

Crafted by half-Japanese artist @K.Nami, this collection is an reflection on the long lasting scars of war. Each trait is carefuly crafted facet of 
war: shattered childhood, seperated family, inflation, greed and gluttony. 

Our design process began with the Shape Network's minimalistic black circle logo. After realizing it resembled a Pac-Man with a closed mouth, the concept evolved into a Pac-like figure, symbolizing the insatiable appetite for resources which is the root of conflicts.

##  On-Chain Strategy Game 

Inspired by the Go, Pac-Man, and Diplomacy, this is an original multi-player "board game" designed by @ubinhash, allowing hundreds of players to compete asynchronously. It puts up players in a battle for scarce resources. The decision to compete, or collaborate, is in the player's hand.

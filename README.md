# ZERO SUM PACT

ZERO SUM PACT brings together art, history, and strategy into an collabratvie on-chain experience.

1. NFT Collection SHAPAC â€“ Crafted by half-Japanese artist @K.Nami, this collection is an reflection on the long lasting scars of war. Each trait is carefuly crafted to represent a facet of 
war: shattered childhood, seperated family, inflation, greed and gluttony. 

Our design process began with the Shape Network's minimalistic black circle logo. After realizing it resembled a Pac-Man with a closed mouth, the concept evolved into a Pac-like figure, perfectly symbolizing cyclical conflict and the insatiable consumption of resources.

2. On-Chain Strategy Game - Inspired by the Go, Pac-Man, and Diplomacy, this is an original multi-player "board game" designed by @ubinhash, allowing hundreds of players to compete asynchronously. It puts up players in a battle for scarce resources. The decision to compete, or collaborate, is in the player's hand.
